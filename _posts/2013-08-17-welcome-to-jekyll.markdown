"Every Web Developer should have a web site". Or something. I heard that from somewhere a while ago but not sure where. I've always been slightly embarassed that – as a web developer myself – I've never been able to fill out the 'website' field on various internet forms. It's been in the back of my mind forever that I should put something together, but, _meh_.

My extraneous coding time has been spent on small personal projects and keeping up with trends; things which are much fun than throwing together some HTML and creating my own infintesimal spot on the web.

Anyway, I've finally got around to it. Here it is. I'll be using this as a place to link to the various places I've placed information on the internet and to – very ocassionally – write a blog post.

I've taken advantage of [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to write this.
